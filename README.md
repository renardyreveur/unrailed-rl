# Unrailed! Co-op Agents with Deep Reinforcement Learning :train:


## Introduction (YAUCA - Yet Another Unrailed! Co-operative Agent project)

(TIL - apparently 'yauca' is a district in Peru)

If you haven't checked out the start of my journey into the RL world, have a look at [trackmania-rl](https://github.com/renardyreveur/trackmania-rl)!

Once I have accustomed myself with the (dark) arts of deep reinforcement learning, my thoughts trailed further into deeper and darker secrets. By that I mean `multi-agent environments`, and **emergent behaviours** such as `cooperation, rivalry, etc`. 

I see that in most cases, things in life follow either one of two paradigms: The first, a **behemoth of a thing that is capable of many complex things**. The other, numerous **small and simple things that en masse produce what seem to be complex phenomenon**. One could argue it's only a matter of scale, but nonetheless, we observe these all around us. This project aims to explore the latter of those two, hoping to see if **independent agents** can `successfully cooperate` in achieving a common goal, `given a medium of communication.` (i.e. scheming little agents :shushing_face:)

## Details

There are a few goals that I'd like to achieve from this project

- Get used to the **general workflow of managing a DRL project**


- Explore various concepts and ideas involving **multi-agent environments**, **emergent behaviours**, and **communication**.


- Make it as **'human'** as possible. 


- Continue developing a working JAX-only framework in designing and training the neural networks


- Make it into a great second episode that will serve as a 'main character backstory' for my RL journeys ahead!
